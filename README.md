# The T-cell repertoire of Spanish patients with COVID-19 as a strategy to link T-cell characteristics to the severity of the disease

Abstract
**Background**: The architecture and dynamics of T cell populations are critical in orchestrating the immune response to SARS-CoV-2. In our study, we used T Cell Receptor sequencing (TCRseq) to investigate TCR repertoires in 173 post-infection COVID-19 patients.

**Methods**: The cohort included 98 mild and 75 severe cases with a median age of 53. We amplified and sequenced the TCR Î² chain Complementary Determining Region 3 (CDR3b) and performed bioinformatic analyses to assess repertoire diversity, clonality, and V/J allelic usage between age, sex and severity groups. CDR3b amino acid sequence inference was performed by clustering structural motifs and filtering validated reactive CDR3b to COVID-19.

**Results**: Our results revealed a pronounced decrease in diversity and an increase in clonal expansion in the TCR repertoires of severe COVID-19 patients younger than 55 years old. These results reflect the observed trends in patients older than 55 years old (both mild and severe). In addition, we identified a significant reduction in the usage of key V alleles (TRBV14, TRBV19, TRBV15 and TRBV6-4) associated with disease severity. Notably, severe patients under 55 years old had allelic patterns that resemble those over 55 years old, accompanied by a skewed frequency of COVID-19-related motifs.

**Conclusions**: Present results suggest that severe patients younger than 55 may have a compromised TCR repertoire contributing to a worse disease outcome.
